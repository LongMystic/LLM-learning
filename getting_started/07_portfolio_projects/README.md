## 7. Portfolio Projects (parallel)

### Goal
Create 2–3 small projects that demonstrate applied LLM & LLMOps skills.

### Project ideas
- FAQ RAG bot over internal or public docs
- Data quality assistant over logs or tables
- Support ticket classifier (fine-tuned with LoRA)

### For each project, include
- README:
  - Problem, approach, and architecture diagram
  - Setup and run instructions
- Implementation:
  - RAG or fine-tuning if appropriate
  - Serving (local API) if appropriate
- Evaluation:
  - Metrics (accuracy/F1, grounding, latency)
  - Regression prompt set and expected outputs
- Notes:
  - Trade-offs (cost vs quality vs latency)
  - Future improvements

### Done when
- You have at least two projects you can show on GitHub or a personal portfolio.
- Each project has clear metrics and a short write-up.
