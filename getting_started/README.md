## LLM & LLMOps Getting Started

This folder breaks your learning path into clear steps, each in its own subfolder:

- `01_foundations/` – Python/ML stack and transformer basics
- `02_llm_apis_and_prompts/` – Using LLM APIs and prompt engineering
- `03_rag/` – Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- `04_finetuning/` – LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning
- `05_serving_llmops/` – Serving, observability, and LLMOps basics
- `06_orchestration_agents/` – Orchestration frameworks and agents
- `07_portfolio_projects/` – Project ideas and checklists

Inside each folder you will typically find:

- `README.md` – what to learn and do for that step
- Optional `explain_about_code.md` – line‑by‑line explanations of example scripts

Start with `01_foundations/README.md` and go in numerical order.
